Try the game live: https://daviddserb.itch.io/2048

Embark on a strategic game within a 4x4 grid, where the challenge lies in sliding squares in every direction â€” left, right, up, and down.
Your mission is to skillfully merge these squares, aiming for the elusive 2048 value to claim victory.

How to play:
1. Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to slide squares in the corresponding direction.
2. Squares with matching values merge upon collision, creating higher-valued squares.
3. Reach the 2048 tile by combining squares strategically.
4. The game ends when no more moves are possible.

After downloading the project, you must:
1. set the Python Interpreter - select the python.exe from the folder where you installed python on the PC.
2. install the packages: numpy and pygame.
